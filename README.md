# 2ftProstheticsClub_Engineering_Hand
This is the repository for the BYU 2ft Prosthetics club Engineering Hand Team. (Winter 2023 creation)

A lot of the code in this repository will likely be .ino files Which are Arduino specific C++ files. 
If you want to code in arduino yourself, download the new arduino IDE software at this link:
